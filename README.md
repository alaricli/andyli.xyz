# Personal Website

This is my personal website, where I showcase my portfolio, share information about myself, and provide links to my projects and social profiles.

## UPDATE

This personal website has been deprecated as I have built a new one using a new domain: alaricli.com. I have decided to start going by my legal name Alaric again. I will be keeping this repo up just in case I need to self-reference on a simple ReactJS application in the future.
